# ML-Red-Wine-Quality

The models used for predicting Red-Wine-Quality in this study involves the following:
1) Random Forest.
2) Decision Tree.
3) Support Vector Machine.
4) K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.


How to run the above script on your local machine?  
  
Install Jupyter Notebook on the local machine by downloding it from official website https://jupyter.org/   
Clone the repository to your local machine. Extract the package and use this path in Jupyter Notebook to run the script.  
```git clone https://github.com/goksha/ML-Wine-Quality.git ```

How to run the above script on Azure ML studio?  
  
Firstly, create a Azure ML studio workplace. Once workplace is created, deploy the compute instance as desired (Note: compute instance with higher configurations can provide results faster i.e, code execution will be faster) wait until azure provisions compute instance. once compute instance is provisioned in the workspace navigate to notebooks under section titled 'Authoring'.  
Once in the notebook menu you can either create a black notebook and clone this repository or upload the cloned repository as files to the notebook to run the script. please make sure to use kernel as 'Python3 Ipykernel' from the kernels menue.
